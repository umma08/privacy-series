\f0\fs28 \cf0 The Privacy Series: Cryptocurrency, Privacy, and the Foundations of Digital Money\
\
The Privacy Series seeks to establish the foundations for regulatory clarity with respect to cryptocurrency and financial privacy. A series of physical events will bring together important voices, from which inclusive, open, and constructive dialogue will be sought. The series will seek to determine varying perspectives of how the foundations of digital money should be laid. This discussion is seen as integral as we move deeper into the 21st century. Decisions that affect society, the economy, and the political sphere should incorporate and understand the delicate balance of individual, corporation, and the state. The perceptions and attitudes towards cryptocurrency technology should be understood so that informed regulatory decisions can be made; constructively supporting the digitally enabled, modern financial systems emerging in the modern age. }
